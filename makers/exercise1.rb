# You should get line 2 to evaluate to 9
p 3 * 3
 
# Get line 4 to evaluate to "Hi there!"
p "Hi there!"
 
# Fix this so that it returns true (as a boolean) You might need to google what .includes does for ruby strings
p "hi".include?("i") 
 
# Waht's wrong with the line below? It should print out "HIYA"
p "HIYA"
